    <h1> Basic principles of Cosmology</h1>
    <ol type="1">
    <LI> All matter in the universe is composed of atoms and molecules.
    <LI> These atoms and molecules are held together by the force of gravity.
    <LI> The universe is expanding and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
    <LI> The age of the universe is estimated to be between 13 and 14 billion years.
    <LI> The stars and other celestial bodies in the universe are all in a constant state of flux. As they move closer to one another, they eventually form new stars and planets. As they move farther apart, they become smaller stars and distant planets.
    <LI> The temperature on the surface of the earth is approximately 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit).
    <LI> Stars with mass greater than our sun will eventually become black holes.
    <LI> The Sun is Earth's primary source of energy.

      The cosmological principle is a physical principle that states that all matter in the universe is uniform throughout space and time. In other words, the cosmological principle states that the laws of nature are the same everywhere and at all times throughout the universe. This principle was first proposed by cosmologist Edwin Hubble in 1929 and bears his name to this day. It implies that the observed large-scale structure of the universe can not be explained by chance or by supernatural causes. Its observation is direct evidence of the expansion of the universe and its uniformity over large scales. Modern telescopes allow us to observe galaxies that are billions of light years away from Earth. Looking deep into space, we can detect fluctuations in the microwave background radiation that proves that the universe was once very hot and dense, but has now cooled and expanded significantly. By looking at these cosmic microwave background fluctuations, we can determine that the universe was formed about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. At present, the diameter of the observable universe is approximately 93 billion light years in diameter, which means that it covers approximately 28 trillion miles.
