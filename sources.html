 Smith, Amanda. “This Artist's Impression Highlights the Four Tails of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy (the Orange Clump on the Left of the Image) That's Presently Orbiting the Milky Way. The Bright Yellow Circle to the Right of the Galaxy's Center Is Our Sun (Not to Scale). The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Is on the Other Side of the Galaxy from Us, but We Can See Its Tidal Tails of Stars (White in This Image) Stretching across the Sky as They Wrap around Our Galaxy. Although Numerous Mergers Have Occurred over Our Galaxy's History, Bringing Globular Clusters and Waves of Star-Formation with Them, We Can Now Trace Our Own Galactic History Back Farther than Ever before.” STARTS WITH A BANG, Big Think, 30 Mar. 2022, https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/milky-way-old-universe/.
