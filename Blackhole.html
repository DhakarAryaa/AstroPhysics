    <h1>Blackholes</h1>
    <p>
      Black holes are a place, not a thing. The gravity blackholes contain has impressive dynamic which bends spacetime (a fabric of 3 dimensions of space and an additional dimension of time) around its boundary. This boundary is known as the event horizon, where an observer can never enter or leave. Therefore a black hole is a region of space where space and time have been stretched to an infinite extent. The black hole temperature is determined by the temperature of the space around it. The bigger the black hole, the more temperature it will be exposed to. Another phenomenon which is related to the temperature of the black hole is called the Hawking radiation. This theory states that as a Black hole evaporates, it emits radiation in the form of protons at a temperature of about 2.7K and can be thought of as the evaporation of the black hole itself. This is referred to as the process of radiation escape from the black hole due to the pressure exerted by the radiation escape from the black hole due to the pressure exerted by the radiation from the hot interior of the hole to the cooler outer region leading to an eventual cooling process. A black hole contains 3 quantities namely electric charge, mass, and spin. The black hole is a celestial body containing a singularity; hence it has no definite limits and thus can not be identified by any combination of those quantities. In fact, even defining the magnitude of the charge and the mass of the black hole cannot be done with any real accuracy as the matter within a black hole does not have any electrical charge associated with it and is also not exactly matter as we know it here on Earth. Instead, to define a black hole mathematically, one has to define a single quantity called “Gravitational Mass” which includes the electric charges of the object within it. When a star explodes into a supernova, what’s left collapses under its own weight. If enough mass exists at the center of the star, it will collapse into a stellar-mass black hole. Stellar mass black holes are formed when the gravitational forces inside a dying star become too strong for the star to withstand. Resulting in an explosion that leaves behind a collapsed ball of dust and gas called a neutron star or ‘neutron star remnant. But if the central density is high enough, then the gravity will be strong enough to over power even the intense nuclear pressure and result in an object which has the same density as our Sun but is the size of the Earth or a slightly smaller version. Another type of blackhole would be the supermassive black holes. These dark objects which reside in the center of most galaxies have masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of times more than our sun. They can exceed the size of our entire solar system or even be larger than a galaxy. They are often difficult to detect since they tend to be very dim and lie behind the bright face of a galaxy’s core, making them impossible to see without the aid of powerful telescopes. However, some supermassive black holes are more active than others. The most energetic of these are known as quasars. They are very bright and very massive and therefore can be seen by telescopes from Earth.
