<h1>Galaxies</h1>
<p>Stars are celestial bodies made of hydrogen and helium that are held together by their gravity. Nuclear fusion reactions in the star's core support the star against gravity and produce heat with small amounts of heavier elements.
Stars are born as gigantic clouds of gas and dust called nebulae that collapse under their weight into stars, giving birth to a whole new generation of stars in a process known as stellar evolution. Once a star is born, it slowly burns through the fuel at its core, eventually running out of fuel and collapsing into a white dwarf or exploding as a supernova.
In our solar system, the planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were formed from the primordial cloud of gas and dust that surrounded the Sun. Over time, gravitational forces attracted small rocks and other matter to the Sun's surface, forming our planets. The gravitational pull of the Sun is what keeps the Earth in its orbit and allows life to exist on Earth. The Sun is one of billions of stars in the universe, which are located throughout the galaxy and the cosmos. Our solar system is one of eight trillion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Scientists are studying the mysteries of the stars to learn more about how the universe was formed and to help us find answers to some of the big questions we have about the world around us.
One of the questions we want to know about the stars is why some of them are brighter than others. Astronomers believe there may be several reasons for this. For example, some stars may have more mass than others because they are larger or have more material in their cores.
