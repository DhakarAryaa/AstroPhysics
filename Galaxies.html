The Milky Way Galaxy, also known as the Andromeda galaxy or simply M31, is one of the most well-known and celebrated galaxies in the universe. It is estimated to contain more than 200 billion stars, making it one of the largest and most complex structures in the known universe. Our solar system is located in the Milky Way's "arms", a region of concentrated star formation around the center of the galaxy. Many neighboring galaxies are visible in the night sky, including the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, and the Orion Nebula. The name "Milky Way" comes from its appearance as a milky band across the sky from Earth's perspective. In this photo from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, infrared light collected is shown as blue hues surrounding visible light collected in red hues. At the center of this image is the massive black hole known as Sagittarius A*, which is home to a globular cluster containing roughly 3 million stars. This black hole is one of the largest black holes found in the Milky Way and has an estimated mass of 4.5 million times that of our sun. <p style="color:grey;">[Galaxies, NASA]</p>

Although it may be difficult to imagine on a basic level, the Universe is literally expanding in all directions. As we look farther into the cosmos, we move further and further away from other galaxies that once were close to us. In other words, we appear to be traveling at ever increasing speeds away from everything else around us. In order to understand why this apparent expansion of the Universe occurs, it is important to first understand the laws of motion. These laws help to explain why objects move the way they do in space, and also help us to understand the behavior of light and sound. Unlike laws of physics such as Newton's law of gravity, the law of motion describes the behavior of everyday objects that are at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line. Objects with mass tend to move under the force of gravity and are pulled towards the center of the Earth or another large object with mass. For example, a ball thrown up in the air will eventually fall back to the ground due to the force of gravity acting on it. According to this law of motion, if an object begins to move in one direction, it will continue to move in that direction unless acted upon by an outside force. For example, a moving car will not stop unless there is an obstacle in its way, or if the driver presses on the brakes and turns the wheel sharply in the opposite direction. Another example of a force that acts against the motion of an object is the friction that occurs between two objects rubbing against each other. Friction causes one object to slow down and stop moving while another one continues to move forward at the same speed. Understanding the concepts of the law of motion is an important part of being able to predict how objects will move and respond to forces acting on them. In this blog post we will learn about some of the basic principles of motion and how these are applied when studying the Universe. We will also explore how our understanding of motion can be used to explain what is observed when we observe the Universe.

When we look at our own galaxy, the Milky Way, we see a circular shape around it which we call the galaxy disk. This galaxy disk is made up mostly of gas and dust, and contains vast quantities of stars and other objects like planets and moons. Scientists have observed many spiral galaxies like ours in the universe, and they use these Spiral Galaxies to help them better understand how our galaxy formed and how other galaxies form as well. The spiral galaxies are organized into three different categories based on their shape and structure.
<ul type="disc">
  <LI>Type I galaxies have a flat appearance with a thin flat plane and are usually made up of gas with very little dust.</LI>
  <LI>Type II galaxies have a central bulge which is a bright region in the middle of their disk, and these galaxies are also known as elliptical galaxies because they are shaped like an ellipse.</LI>
  <LI> Type III galaxies are the spirals that we are interested in here. These galaxies are shaped like “S” or “W” shapes and usually have more dust and gas than other types of galaxies. </LI>
</ul>
  <br>Spiral galaxies are closely related to the Whirlpool Galaxy which we will be looking at in more detail later in this post. These S-shaped galaxies develop from huge clouds of gas and dust and then get pulled together due to gravity to form an elongated flattened disk shape. As we said earlier, scientists think that a spiral galaxy like our Milky Way started forming about 12 billion years ago from a cloud of gas which started to swirl around due to the force exerted by nearby galaxies. As the cloud of gas began to spin faster and faster, it eventually collapsed in on itself to form a point-like object called a black hole. Then, over the next 10 billion years, most of the mass in the cloud condensed into the center of the black hole which formed the center of our galaxy. The rest of the gas cloud continued to swirl around the black hole in a flattened disk shape and eventually developed into the galaxy that we see today. So far we have seen that all stars have a life cycle just like the animals on Earth including humans! But not all stars are created equally

Type I galaxies do not have a disk or bulge in their structure and are classified as either elliptical or lenticular in shape. These galaxies are generally low in stellar content and are therefore very low in mass as well. Typically these galaxies are between 100 million and 1 billion years old and are one of the most abundant types of galaxies in the sky today.
Type II galaxies are similar to those classified as type I galaxies, however they have a bulge in their structure made up of a mixture of gas and stars. The diameter of these types of galaxies tends to be between 200 million and 500 million light years.
TypeIII galaxies do not have the same characteristics as the previous two types and as a result are considered an irregular type of galaxy. These types of galaxies tend to have more structures than the first two types and consequently a higher mass and larger diameter than other galaxies. It is estimated that type III galaxies may account for approximately 40% of all known galaxies in the universe.
An ‘elliptical’ galaxy has a more or less oval shape whereas a ‘lenticular’ galaxy is shaped like an elongated lens. It is generally believed that both types I and II galaxies are elliptical while type III galaxies are lenticular in appearance.
